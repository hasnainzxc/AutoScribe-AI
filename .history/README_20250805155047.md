# Content Generation Pipeline

A Python-based content pipeline that automatically generates Rick and Morty style videos from Reddit posts. The pipeline fetches interesting posts from Reddit, converts them into dialogues between Rick and Morty, and creates videos with text-to-speech audio.

This repository contains a modular, extensible framework for automating the creation of short-form content from Reddit posts. It is designed to evolve over time: you can start with simple heuristics and gradually swap in more advanced components (e.g. large language models, richer dialogue generators) without having to change the overall structure.

## Directory Structure

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies.  The only required third‑party package is
   [`praw`](https://praw.readthedocs.io/).  You can install it via pip:

   ```bash
   pip install praw
   ```

2. Set up Reddit API credentials.  Create an app on
   [reddit.com/prefs/apps](https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps) and note
   the client ID and secret.  Then set the following environment
   variables:

   ```bash
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID=<your_client_id>
   export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET=<your_client_secret>
   export REDDIT_USER_AGENT="your_bot_name"
   ```

3. Run the story generator from the command line.  For example, to
   generate dialogues for the top 5 posts in `r/aws` from the past day:

   ```bash
   python -m content_pipeline.story_generation.story_generator aws -n 5 -s top -t day
   ```

   This prints a JSON array of dialogues, each containing two lines:
   the host's question and the expert's answer.

## Extending the Pipeline

This project is intentionally minimal to get you started.  Consider
adding the following as your needs grow:

* **Improved summarisation**: Replace the naive sentence extraction with
  calls to a summarisation model or LLM.
* **Richer dialogue**: Use an LLM to craft multiple exchanges, add
  humour or storytelling, and customise the personalities of the host
  and expert characters.
* **Additional ingestion sources**: Create modules under `ingestion/`
  to pull content from RSS feeds, blogs, or other social media.
* **Media generation**: Integrate video and audio synthesis tools
  downstream of this pipeline to produce complete animated clips.
